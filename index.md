**Faculty Advisor:** Kristopher Ramsay

**Piazza Discussion Page:**

**Description:** This course is designed to prepare incoming Politics Ph.D. students for POL 502 (Mathematics for Political Scientists) and other coursework in Formal & Quantitative Methods. It reviews calculus and linear algebra and introduces fundamental ideas of real analysis.

The course consists of two parts. The **preview component** be completed by students remotely and will run from June 11 to August 16. Students will watch video lectures and complete weekly problem sets on topics in calculus and linear algebra. The **camp component** will take place in Princeton from August 27 to September 7. Class will meet twice daily and students will complete daily problem sets.

**Course Structure:** We will post a problem set every Friday during the preview component. The schedule below will contain links to the assignments and relevant video lectures. We encourage you to post questions to the Piazza discussion page about the material in the video lectures and the assignments. We will do our best to answer them quickly.

The camp will meet for 9 days (Labor Day exempted) with a morning session and an afternoon session each day. The morning session will meet from 10:00am to 11:50am, and the afternoon session will meet from 1:30pm to 3:20pm. We will post a daily problem set at the conclusion of each afternoon session in the schedule section below.

**Requirements:** Students are required to complete the weekly problem sets during the preview period and the daily problem sets during the camp period. Problem sets during the preview component are due by **midnight each Thursday** (see table of deadlines below). Completed problem sets should be sent by email to **address**. We understand that summer often features travel and other activities that get in the way of doing math. Please get in touch if you don't think you'll be able to submit assignments by their due date, and we'll work on an alternative schedule for you. 

Problem sets during the camp component are due by **10:00am the morning after they are distributed**. Students are encouraged to work together on the problem sets, but are expected to write up their solutions individually. The camp will conclude with a final exam given in class on **DATE**.

LaTeX is a typesetting system that will likely become a big part of your life as a graduate student. This summer is a good time to get familiar with it. We ask that you begin submitting typed problem sets by **week 3 of the preview component.** Below, we provide links to tutorials to help you get started. Feel free to post questions about how to use the system on Piazza. Learning is a slog at the beginning, but it will make your life much easier down the road. 

**Textbooks:** None of these are required, but you may find them useful. Banner's *The Calculus Lifesaver* is the companion text for the Calculus video lectures. Strang's *Linear Algebra* is the companion text for the Linear Algebra video lectures. You may find the other textbooks helpful for the camp and other courses at Princeton.

### Getting Started with LaTeX

First thing's first, you'll need to download a LaTeX distribution and a text editor suitable for drafting LaTeX documents.

**Distributions**

- [MiKTeX (Windows)](https://miktex.org/)
- [MacTeX (Mac)](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)

**Text Editors**

- [TeXmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
- [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)

Loading [Jennifer Pan](http://jenpan.com/)'s [problem set template](http://jenpan.com/jen_pan/PsetLatexTemplate.tex) into your text editor of choice will give you a sense of how .tex documents are constructed. Both TeXmaker and TeXstudio have buttons that will compile your .tex document into a clean .pdf.

The tricky and painful part will be getting comfortable with LaTeX's syntax. Googling questions about LaTeX syntax will often turnup results on [StackExchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/), many of which can be very helpful. We suggest spending some time in broader tutorials before diving in to specifics.
